# CLRS_Implementation

## Overview
This repo contains the implementation of the algorithms found in the "CLRS" book - **Introduction to Algorithms**, Third edition. Details of the algorithm and implementation will be given in the code's README file.

## Language & Compiler
I will be mainly using C++ to implement the various algorithms. GNU C++ compiler will be used to compile all the code.  

## Input & Output
Input to the various algorithms will be provided by an input file and the output will again be written to a file. The user can choose which files by giving in the necessary arguments.

## Code Organization
Each chapter will have a separate folder and each algorithm will be a folder inside its chapter's folder.
